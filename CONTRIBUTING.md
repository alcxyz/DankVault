# Contributing to DankVault

## Development setup

Prerequisites: [DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell) >= 1.4.0, at least one supported backend (rbw, pass, gopass, or op)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alcxyz/DankVault.git
cd DankVault
```

For development, symlink the plugin into the DMS plugins directory:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.config/DankMaterialShell/plugins/DankVault
```

Reload after changes:

```bash
dms ipc call plugins reload dankVault
```

## Project structure

- `plugin.json` -- plugin manifest (id, type, trigger, permissions)
- `DankVault.qml` -- main launcher component (backend registry, getItems, executeItem, context menu)
- `DankVaultSettings.qml` -- settings UI

## Adding a backend

Backends are defined in the `_backends` map inside `DankVault.qml`. Each backend provides:

- `listCommand()` — returns a command array to list entries
- `parseListOutput(text)` — parses stdout into `[{id, name, user, folder}]`; `id` is optional when `name` is already the backend's canonical lookup key
- `getFieldCommand(entryName, entryUser, fieldName)` — returns a command array to get a field value; `entryName` receives `id` when the parsed entry provides one
- `errorHint` — help text shown when the backend fails

Add a new entry to `_backends`, a detection entry in `detectProcess`, and a settings option in `DankVaultSettings.qml`.

## Testing

Run the fast source and parsing checks directly:

```bash
./test.sh
```

Run the real `pass` and `gopass` nested-entry integration test with disposable GPG and password-store directories:

```bash
nix-shell -p gnupg pass gopass --run ./test-integration.sh
```

The integration test redirects GPG, password-store, XDG, and Git configuration into a temporary directory and removes it on exit.

## Making changes

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `dev`
2. Make your changes
3. Test by reloading the plugin in DMS
4. Open a pull request against `dev`

## Commit messages

Use conventional-ish prefixes to keep history scannable:

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only
- `chore:` maintenance, CI, dependencies
- `refactor:` code changes that don't add features or fix bugs

## Releasing

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. The `version` field in `plugin.json` is the source of truth for release tags.

Normal development and contributor PRs target `dev` and do not require a version bump. The `main` branch is protected and is used for releases.

To cut a release:

1. Make sure `dev` contains the changes to release.
2. Create a release branch from `dev`, for example `release/v0.2.3`.
3. Bump the `version` field in `plugin.json` on the release branch unless the release is documentation-only.
4. Open a pull request from the release branch to `main`.
5. Merge with a merge commit, not a squash, after review and checks pass. CI creates the git tag and GitHub release from `plugin.json.version`.
6. Merge `main` back into `dev` after the release so `dev` receives the released metadata; this merges cleanly because `main` keeps the release branch history.

### Version numbering

Follow [semver](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch** (`v0.1.x`): bug fixes, minor tweaks
- **Minor** (`v0.x.0`): new features, non-breaking changes
- **Major** (`vx.0.0`): breaking changes
